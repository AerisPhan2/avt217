	 <h1>Food.</h1>
	<h3><a href="https://www.food.com/">https://www.food.com/</a></h3>

	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>I think the website did relatively well for their navigation. They had categories that had things under them that I could click and the things that were under each one made sense. </p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>All of the links seem to work fine- but the search bar at the bottom didn't seem to be functioning as it should because nothing popped up whenever I put in the name of a food. Clicking on the "see them all" or the links from the categories at the top lead to this large page with oddly spaced boxes with text. It feels like there were supposed to be pictures to accompany the boxes. </p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>It is well balanced. The most important part of the website, being the food, is displayed the largest and is immediately seen by the eye the moment I go onto the website, which is perfect for its food theme. Nothing feels out of place and everything is aligned.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The aesthetics are nothing impressive, but it gets the information it needs to get across in an efficient and digestible manner. The images of the food being practically everywhere also help work up the appetite, so that's a nice bonus.</p>
